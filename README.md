# Project Skeleton
[Project Skeleton](http://www.projectskeleton.com) is a web forum devoted to project challenges.

It allows you to use project specifications and a creative community to bring your ideas to life.

## Features to Implement
There is still plenty to work on for Project Skeleton. Here are a few features I plan to add:

+ Significant code refactoring and DRYing out to improve readability and to reduce code duplication
+ Add a "Learn More" link on the front page that leads to a stylish page featuring helpful graphics and information about the site
+ Add Markdown options for comments
+ Visual feedback on likes and dislikes.
  Use cookies to save the visual feedback for each particular user's votes.
+ Add pagination/infinite scroll and friendly URLS (words instead of numbers)
+ Add user private messaging
+ More consistent, pixel-perfect design and layout
