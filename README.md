# Project Skeleton
[Project Skeleton](https://www.projectskeleton.com) is a web forum devoted to projects, challenges, and prompts.

It allows you to use project specifications and a creative community to spark your imagination to make cool things.

## Features to Implement
There is still plenty to work on for Project Skeleton. Here are a few features I plan to add:

+ Add Markdown.js for comments
+ Create clickable embedded images that expand to full size
+ Use Filepicker to add avatars for sub sidebars
+ Visual feedback on likes and dislikes.
  Use cookies to save the visual feedback for each particular user's votes.
